# Portfolio Project
For my chatbot, I decided to use Dialog Flow <br />
I used 6 Intents for the Chatbot<br />
Class for what relevant class work <br />
Fallback intent for invalid text <br />
Lang for languages <br />
Welcoming the user to the website <br />
Lastly a brief sample of who Justin in <br />
I implemented it through a JavaScript framework with Dialog Flow <br />
I tested with the testing system built into Dialog Flow <br />
and placed it in the header. <br />
